## What is IRC (Internet Relay Chat)?

IRC is a chat medium that was first used in 1988. 

## Why do people still use IRC?

IRC allows you to encrypt your chat conversations together with a tool like IRSSI or Pidgin. 

Personally, I use IRC because I can use it directly in Terminal, which makes me feel _really cool_. To run IRC in Terminal, you can use a program like IRSSI. It looks like this on my setup:

(I feel like a HACKER)

I also use IRC because the Tor Project uses it for most of their meetings.
