## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a programming language that you can use to make websites and other documents.

Markdown is nice because it's much more user friendly than HTML. However, it doesn't allow you to do as many things as HTML.

## How can I use Markdown?

This document is written using Markdown! You can also use Markdown together with a program like Lektor to make your own website. 

Markdown is also used to style comments on sites like Reddit. Using Markdown, you can **bold** or *italicize* or ~~strike-through~~ text, or even
* make
* a 
* bulleted
* list.

Some websites will use their own slightly different version of Markdown.
