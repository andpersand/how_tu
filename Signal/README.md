## What is Signal?

Signal is an encrypted chat app that you can download on your mobile device or computer.

## How can I use Signal?

To use Signal on mobile, you'll just need to download it from your mobile app store. To do this, open your app store and type "Signal" into the search bar. Then tap 'Install.' 

As I'm writing this document, the icon currently looks like a blue square with a white speech bubble inside. 

Once you've installed the app, you can open it up and start setting up your account. 

__Note:__ During the setup process, Signal will ask you to grant it some permissions. You don't need to grant any of these permissions, but you might need to later if you want to do certain things. (For more information on these permissions, check out Signal's [documentation](https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007062172-Signal-Permissions).

To start using Signal, you'll need to enter your phone number. Make sure this is a real phone number that you have access to, because Signal will send a verification code to you through an SMS message. Once you've received the verification code, type it into the box that Signal provides. 

If you've entered the code correctly, your account will be verified, and you'll be asked to set a profile name and picture. Your picture and name can be whatever you want, so feel free to use a fake name or a nickname.

Signal will ask if you want to use it as your default SMS app. I personally don't recommend this setting, because if you try to send an encrypted SMS to someone who doesn't have Signal, the message will be sent without encryption. To avoid any confusion, and to keep myself safe, I choose not to set Signal as my default SMS app. This makes it harder for me to accidentally send an unencrypted message to someone who I thought was using Signal, too. However, if you want to, you can choose to make Signal your default texting app. 

Now that you're all setup, you can send encrypted messages to people who already have Signal installed. 

## What do the Signal settings do? 

Here we'll explain some of the settings in Signal's settings menu.

## Important notes

At this point in time, the desktop versions of Signal are not as up-to-date, and so they may be less secure than mobile versions. For this reason, we recommend that if you're able, you use Signal on mobile rather than on your desktop.

It's also not recommended that you use Signal on more than one platform, because doing this could decrease your security. So, if you usually use Signal on your phone, stick to that - don't use it on your desktop, too. 

We say all this simply as a recommendation. We know that only _you_ really know what's best and safest for you. So, if you think the convenience of using Signal on multiple platforms outweighs the security risks, then you're of course free to use it on both your computer and your mobile phone.
