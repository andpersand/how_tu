## What is CSS?

CSS is a programming language that allows you to add _style_ to a website. CSS takes a plain HTML website skeleton and makes it look... much better.

## What can I do with CSS?

With CSS, you can add colors, shapes, animations, fonts, and most importantly, visual structure to a website. 

Before CSS, your HTML might look like this:
[//]: # (HTML site image)

After CSS, the same website might look like this:
[//]: # (HTML+CSS site image)
