# 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)

## What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)? 

2FA is a security measure that allows you to add an extra verification step (or factor) to a login. You can turn on 2FA for many of your online accounts (including Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Instagram, and others). 

Usually, Two-factor authentication works by sending a verification code or URL to your phone or email _after_ you've already correctly entered your username and password. Sometimes, 2FA is entering a code that another app will generate for you. When you visit the URL or enter the code you received, your identity will be verified, and you'll be able to login to your account. 

You can even use a physical device like a Ubikey that will allow you to verify your identity by tapping the device to your phone, or plugging it into your computer's USB drive.

## A metaphor

2FA is sort of like Cinderella's slipper. Cinderella shows up and tells the Prince who she is, but he doesn't believe her until the shoe fits her foot. In this case, Cinderella's physical presence and verbal statement are her username and password, and the shoe is her two-factor authentication.
